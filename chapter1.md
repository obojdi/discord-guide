## FIRST TIME USERS

_*If it’s not your first time using Discord, you can skip passed this first part._

First off, if you came through the link and HAVE NEVER used Discord before, you’re definitely on the WEB VERSION of the application. Now web versions are nice and all, but here’s a download link to the slick, beautiful Desktop & Mobile Versions :

[https://discordapp.com/apps](https://discordapp.com/apps)

_Versions for: Windows, MAC for Desktops | Apple IOS & Android for Mobile_

Now you might have lots of little yellow exclamation marks everywhere. That’s Discord trying to teach you stuff. You can go ahead and read what they have to say. Just in case you didn’t and just skipped through their whole tutorial (which I think most people will), whatever they cover will also be in this guide, so don’t worry. ![😉](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/emoji/twemoji/svg/1f609.svg)

Here’s a screenshot of what your Discord client looks like. We’ll use this as a base to explain what exactly is going on.

[![2015-08-25_2251](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/2015-08-25_2251.png?w=700&h=429)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/2015-08-25_2251.png) 

Now the very first thing you might want to do is play around with your settings. WE’LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING ELSE SOON SO DON’T WORRY. Click on the gear you see on the bottom left of the screen. Here’s a screenshot if you’re having trouble finding it:

[![2015-08-26_2006](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/2015-08-26_2006.png?w=700&h=429)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/2015-08-26_2006.png) 

Once you click there, you’ll see a window similar to this next screenshot. [![2015-08-25_2310](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/2015-08-25_2310.png?w=700)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/2015-08-25_2310.png) 

This settings page is basically where you set all of your preferences. We’ll do that first to make Discord feel a little more like home (and get rid of some notifications in case you just joined a populated server!).

### Settings – Account

On the Account tab, you can change your email as well as your display picture. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to change your display picture so you don’t LOOK like a newbie. Show people that you know how to use this thing. ![😉](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/emoji/twemoji/svg/1f609.svg) . Make sure you enter your current password in that field. It won’t let you save this page otherwise.

### Settings – Text & Images

On the Text & Images tab, there are options concerning images, videos and link embeds into the chat. You can play around in those settings if you want!

### Settings – Voice

On the Voice tab, you can manage all things related to voice Input and Output. This means that you can select your speaking device, as well as the device you want another speaker’s voice to come out of. Default volume levels can also be set for both.

This section also has an Input Mode field. This currently has two modes. I’ll explain them both briefly:

*   Voice Activity: Automatically unmutes your microphone when it detects your voice. When this is selected, you can set the sensitivity at which your voice gets recognized. You can play around and experiment with this to find the perfect settings.
*   Push to Talk: Just like it implies, you can push a button to unmute your mic. When it’s selected, you can define which key you want to set. Pressing that key will unmute your microphone.

This section also has an Advanced tab where you can further adjust your microphone settings. I recommend playing around with all of this and testing with a friend to find your perfect settings for your microphone.

### Settings – Notifications

Here, you can adjust all of your notification options. The settings here are pretty straightforward, so I’ll let you adjust those yourself.

Note that the Text-To-Speech options here refer to a pretty cool/potentially annoying feature that we’ll cover later!

### Settings – Keybinds

Here, you can _bind_ keys to specific actions. For example, if you want your mic to be muted when you press CTLR + 8, then you can configure it here. Currently, there are only 4 actions you can assign keybinds to:

*   Push to Talk – Mic will be unmuted as long as the keybind is held.
*   Push to Mute – Mic will be muted as long as the keybind is held.
*   Toggle Mute – Pressing the keybind will mute/unmute your mic.
*   Toggle Deafen – Pressing the keybind will mute/unmute others (for you).

### Settings – Privacy

Currently only has a single setting to enable showing the currently running game on your computer as a status message. This only seems to detect most popular games and most Steam games as well.

More to come though!

### Settings – Appearance

You may have noticed in the screenshots that my Discord client was cooler than yours. This is where you can toggle between the Light and Dark themes. More themes to come in the future as well!

Alright. Now that all those settings are adjusted, let’s get on to the good stuff.

## Discord Basics

Now, to understand discord, you need to understand just how written/voice communication is organized in here. Many people transferring over from Skype might not be used to this, so pay close attention!

Let’s take another look at the main discord window. [![2015-08-26_2100](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/2015-08-26_2100.png?w=700&h=429)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/2015-08-26_2100.png) 

Look! Pretty colored boxes now!

These 4 sections on the left are the most important things to cover when it comes to the basics of using Discord. So we’ll get right into them.

### Servers

[![2015-08-26_2100](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/2015-08-26_2100.png?w=700&h=429)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/2015-08-26_2100.png) 

Within the green colored box, we’ve got the list of Servers. Not everyone will be used to this terminology, so if you’re confused just think of these as Groups from Skype. That is essentially what they are.

If you’re reading this whole guide you’re probably only a part of one server or so, and you got in here through invite. Every time you click an invite link and join a server, it will be added to this list.

Each server in discord is a separate communication environment. Once you enter a server or click on one, everything to the right of the server list is part of the server. Simply enough, each server is organized into Text Channels & Voice Channels, which we’ll cover shortly!

Last thing to note about servers is that they have specific settings and configurations. If you were invited to a server, you most likely don’t have access to these settings, but for those that want to play around in the settings of their own server and see just what kind of configurations can be made on servers, here’s a screenshot pointing to their configuration page.

[![2015-09-01_2026](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-01_2026.png?w=700)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-01_2026.png) 

I won’t get into the detail of server configuration just yet, and most likely leave that for later since mostly server moderators/managers will be using those functions. Now enough of servers. Let’s get to the REAL stuff. ![:)](https://s1.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/simple-smile.svg)

### Text Channels && Voice Channels

[![2015-08-26_2100](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/2015-08-26_2100.png?w=700&h=429)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/2015-08-26_2100.png) 

Check out the blue colored box. People coming into a server might get super confused when they see a million text channels and voice channels under them, all with custom names and stuff. Thankfully we’re about to clarify just what these are.

Text Channels in Discord are basically different chat rooms within a server. It doesn’t get any more complex than that! We can add a large amount of different rooms that users can access simply by clicking them. When you click on a text channel, the chat for that channel is instantly loaded up.

If you notice that you can’t type/read in certain channels and whatnot, that’s because of permissions. Within a server, different permissions can be set for different channels, and managers can basically select who can type as well who can read in each channel. Permissions will be covered in more details in my soon to come server management guide. ![:)](https://s1.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/simple-smile.svg)

Having text channels is great for the sake of separating chat topics or purposes. You can also have chats solely for certain users, like a chat for Managers. If you’re in a server with your group of friends, you can separate chats for the different games you play.

[![2015-08-26_2100](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-08-26_2100.png?w=700)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-08-26_2100.png) 

Voice Channels are not any more complex. Once you click on a voice channel, your microphone will be able to voice chat with others in that channel. In this screenshot, nobody is currently in those voice channels, but here’s what it looks like when people are in them.

[![2015-09-05_1528](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1528.png?w=700)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1528.png) 

So there on the left, you can see that I’m in a voice channel with threeothers. For Skype users, think of these channels as separate calls that you see at the same time and can join simply with a click.

Right below the voice channel, you have more options for voice communication. To the right of Voice Connected, you can click the little phone icon to disconnect your microphone and leave all voice channels. Under that, next to your name, both the microphone and headphone icons are mute buttons. These will mute yourspeech and hearing respectively.

Last but not least for voice communication, you can actually control the volume at which you hear others! So basically, if someone’s mic is too loud for you, you can manually tune down their own volume to adjust to your liking, instead of being like “Hey dude, your mic is too loud. Can you adjust your volume.”. THIS is pretty neat, and this next screenshot will show you guys how easy it is.

[![2015-09-05_1528_001](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1528_001.png?w=700)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1528_001.png) 

So you see the options right there. Pretty self-explanatory. Some extra options appear here since I have more permissions than a regular user. Those should also be covered in the management portion of the guide later!

### Avatar Icon

In the upper left in red, we got the Avatar Icon. Now if you’re new you might be wondering why the heck I’m showing you your own avatar. There’s a lot more to it than it currently looks like!

If you click on this avatar, you will be brought to another page where you can see a list of contacts you can send private messages to (Right below you can see a screenshot of mine). Now for those of you used to skype, you might be saying “Well okay. How do I add people to my contacts and whatnot?”. And the answer is that, currently, you simply don’t!

[![2015-09-01_2004](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-01_2004.png?w=700)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-01_2004.png) 

This might be weird to get used to at first, but all users from all Servers you joined are piled up into this list. Therefore, you don’t really control who you add / remove, as there really is no “Friend’s list”…For now. ![😉](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/emoji/twemoji/svg/1f609.svg)

In any case, if you want to chat 1-on-1, click on this avatar and click on the name of the person you want to chat with. This will open the chat for that person.

Alright. Now that should cover all of Discord’s basic functionalities. I’ll be adding more to this section if ever I realize I forgot something. Also, feel free to let me know of anything I should add to this section!

Next up, some tips and tricks to get started with using this beast!

* * *

## Cool Stuff

We got through all of the beginner stuff, and now we want to start using it like a pro. I’m gonna teach you guys a couple tricks that you may not know about. ![😉](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/emoji/twemoji/svg/1f609.svg)

### Discord Link Generation

So I basically covered earlier what happens when you join a server, but I didn’t cover joining servers and inviting people. The way it works in Discord is kind of unique, so I’ll take a little time to explain it!

To join or invite others to servers (or groups if you may), you use a URL (link). Here’s an example of what a link to a server is like:

[https://discord.gg/0QqQmEmHPBEpFEtO](https://discord.gg/0QqQmEmHPBEpFEtO)

To join the server, you simply have to click on this link, paste it into your browser or even paste it into Discord itself (in a chat or through the Join Server button).

The following two screenshots demonstrate how to bring others to a server.

[![2015-09-05_1620](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1620.png?w=700)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1620.png) 

Click on the link shown in the screenshot to generate a link. The reason why the button is placed on a channel is because you can invite people to specific channels (they still get access to the whole server when they arrive though!).

[![2015-09-05_1626](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1626.png?w=700)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1626.png) 

This small window is the instant invite window where you can get the link. Other people that click this link will be brought straight to the Discord channel that you linked them to, and will be prompted to create an account if they haven’t already. Pretty neat if you ask me. ![😉](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/emoji/twemoji/svg/1f609.svg)

The orange square is the link. The blue square shows the twitter button, basically allowing you to share the discord link directly on twitter. Lastly, the black button basically puts the link into your clipboard if you’re too cool to CTLR+C.

It’s important to note that all links have a limited lifespan. The timer in the window shows how long the link is active for. After that time runs out, the link will be disabled. You can customize the lifespan in the Advanced Settings accessed by clicking the button right below!

### Chatting Like A Pro

Now the chat in Discord has a lot of tricks to it just like Skype and other text-based communication software. These things aren’t really shown in Discord’s tutorial, so I’ll show you guys!

#### @Mentions

Just like Twitter and other services, @ mentions work in discord. If you type in @ into the chat, Discord will generate the list of users in the given Server. Typing in @[USERNAME], [USERNAME] being the name of the user, will highlight that person’s name in blue and send a notification to them with the message you send. Use this to easily address one or several people!

[![2015-09-05_1844](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1844.png?w=700)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1844.png) 

Typing @everyone in chat sends a notification to everyone in the server. (This can be managed in permissions, so if it doesn’t work in the server you’re in,you may not be allowed to!)

#### Text Formatting

Many people might not know about this, but there is in fact text formatting in Discord’s chat! I’ll show you guys all of the different formats your text can have using symbols to surround your text. In fact, here’s a screenshot showing all of the examples.

[![2015-09-05_1955](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1955.png?w=700)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1955.png) 

Try them out and have fun with em~

#### Message Editing/Removal

Editing a message is clean and simple. All you have to do is press the Up Arrow Key on your keyboard, and you’ll immediately entering editing of your last message.

[![2015-09-05_1958](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1958.png?w=700)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1958.png) 

If you want to edit an older message, hover your mouse over your message. All the way to the right, you’ll see a gear icon. Click this to either edit or remove your message.

[![2015-09-05_1958_001](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1958_001.png?w=700)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_1958_001.png) 

#### Channel References

Similar to @ mentions, you can reference channels using the hashtag(#). This will highlight your text and make it a hyperlink. If users click on it while it’s in chat, it’ll immediately bring them to that said channel! (Remember that the said channel has to be available in the server though.

[![2015-09-05_2001](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_2001.png?w=700)](https://aigachu.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2015-09-05_2001.png) 

#### TTS (Text-To-Speech)

Lastly, we got everyone’s favorite feature: Text-To-Speech.

In any text channel, there’s a command called /tts that you can use to broadcast a message to the server in text-to-speech format. A voice will play out and read the message that you write. I invite you to try this command out in a personal server just to see exactly what I mean.
